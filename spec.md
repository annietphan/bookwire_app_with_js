# Specifications for the Rails with JavaScript Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Must have a Rails Backend and new requirements implemented through JavaScript.
- [x] Make use of ES6 features as much as possible (e.g. arrow functions, `let` & `const`).
- [x] Must translate the JSON responses into Javascript Model Objects using either ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
- [x] At least one of the JS Model Objects must have a method on the prototype. (Book has formatShow method & formatIndex method)
- [x] Must render at least one show page (show resource - 'one specific thing') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend. (from my_books rendered through JS, you can click on the specific book to render a show page via JS)
- [x] Must render at least one index page (index resource - 'list of things') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON Backend. (when you click on my_books you get an index of your books rendered vi JS)
- [x] Your Rails application must return at least one serialized `has-many` relationship through JSON that is then rendered to the page. (add the reviews in the formatIndex -> Show situation bc new book doesn't have reviews yet)
- [x] Must use your Rails application to render a form for creating a resource that is submitted dynamically through JavaScript, using a JSON response of the newly created resource to render to the DOM without a page refresh. (new book form)
